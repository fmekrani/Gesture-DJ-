# GestureDJ

GestureDJ is a browser-first, gesture-controlled DJ console built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. This scaffold covers project setup (M1). Upcoming milestones add the audio engine, waveform rendering, MediaPipe Hands tracking, gesture mapping, and full UI polish.

```

## Production build

npm start
```

## Vercel deployment

## Notes
